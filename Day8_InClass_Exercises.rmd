# Exercises: 

Make a list that contains the information on a single playing card. Suit, face, and value. 

```{r}
information <- list(
  Suit <- c("Diamonds", "Spades", "Hearts", "Clubs"),
  Face <- c("King", "Queens", "Jacks"),
  Value <-c("One", "Two", "Three"))
information

```


Make a second list where each element contains all the options for suit, face, and value, respectively. 

```{r}


```


If `Newlist <- list(a=1:10, b="Good morning", c="Hi")`, write an R statement that will add 1 to each element of the first vector in Newlist.

```{r}
Newlist <- list(a=1:10, b="Good morning", c="Hi")
Newlist$a + 1


```

If `b <- list(a=1:10, c="Hello", d="AA")`, write an R expression that will give all elements of the first vector of b, except the second, and write another that returns only elements of `a` that are greater than 7.

```{r}
b <- list(a=1:10, c="Hello", d="AA")
b$a[-2]
b$a[b$a >7]

```

Let `x <- list(a=5:10, c="Hello", d="AA")`, write an R statement to add a new item z = "NewItem" to the list x.

```{r}
x <- list(a=5:10, c="Hello", d="AA")
x$z <- "NewItem"

```
